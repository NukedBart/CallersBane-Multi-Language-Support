Multi Language Utilities for the game CallersBane(Scrolls)

To use these utilities, you have to install dnSpy and disassemble the Assembly-C-Sharp.dll in the CallersBane_Data/Managed/ folder, implement all of the classes in the MultiLanguageSupport folder, and replace all classes in the NativeClassImplementation folder. Save all and you're good to go!
